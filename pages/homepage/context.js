              Our idea of "Different Lenses"
            </div>
            <div className="font-Lora text-justify">
              When we're talking about different lenses, we mean different eyes,
              various individuals, and every individual is unique in their way,
              made uniquely, would see things differently and perceive it based
              on their ideology and thinking process, which may also include the
              experiences they've had in the past. Since no two occasions can be
              the same, no two views will ever match entirely. It is imperative
              to look beyond our perspective and understand that everyone is
              different (and hence has a distinctive perspective) because only
              then can a society live in peace and harmony. Understanding that
              we're all very different will also make the world a more
              empathetic and better place to live in, I firmly believe so. So
              herewith this theme, we will bring the seen and the unseen world
              together for everyone to see the horizon of perspectives.

                    Jamia Millia Islamia made a modest beginning in 1920 at Aligarh, with the resolute determination of its founders. Shaikhul Hind Maulana Mahmud Hasan, Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar, Jenab Hakim Ajmal Khan, Dr. Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari, Jenab Abdul Majeed Khwaja, and Dr. Zakir Hussain to create an institution that would manifest indigenous ethos and spirit of plurality.
                It was conceived as a national institution that would offer progressive education and nationalist ideals to students from all communities, particularly the Muslims. The emergence of Jamia was supported by Gandhiji and Tagore who felt that Jamia could shape lives of hundreds and thousands of students on the basis of a shared culture and worldview. Jamiaâ€™s development is marked by sacrifices made by the staff and students and a host of individuals who contributed through myriad efforts.
