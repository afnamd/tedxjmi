Since no two occasions can be the same, no two views will ever match entirely. It is imperative to look beyond our perspective and understand that everyone is different (and hence has a distinctive perspective) because only then can a society live in peace and harmony. Understanding that we&#x27;re all very different will also make the world a more empathetic and better place to live in, I firmly believe so. So herewith this theme, we will bring the seen and the unseen world together for everyone to see the horizon of perspectives.</div></div><div class="pt-20 p-4 flex flex-col gap-4 "><div class="text-3xl md:text-4xl text-center md:text-left font-Cinzel">The TEDx Conference</div><div class="font-Lora">TEDxJMI brings together a collection of doers, thinkers, innovators, explorers, visionaries, teachers and learners We seek to illuminate, inspire, change perceptions, incite action and foster new connections.
