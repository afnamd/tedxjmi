{"pageProps":{"year":2021,"theme":"Different Lenses","description":"When we're talking about different lenses, we mean different eyes, diverse senses of multifarious individuals, each one unique in its way with a different standpoint, ideology, and way of vitality. This incites a question in our minds, how are we shaped? What molds our thought process? Is it our actions, choices, or the experiences we've had in the past? This takes us to the conclusion that since no two occasions can be the same, no two views will ever match entirely. It is imperative to look beyond our perspective and understand that everyone is distinct and consequently has a distinguishing outlook. It is this diversity that is responsible for the equilibrium in society, harmony in multiplicity, and peace in variousness. The understanding of these nuances makes the world a little more empathetic, and a better place to live in. So herewith this theme, we will bring the seen and the unseen world together for everyone to see the horizon of perspectives.","Previous":{"year":2019,"href":"/archive/2019"}},"__N_SSG":true}
