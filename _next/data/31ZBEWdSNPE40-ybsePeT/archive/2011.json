{"pageProps":{"year":2011,"theme":"Switcheroo","description":"With TEDxJMI themed as switcheroo we want to bring people who endorse the idea of switching careers successfully to a common stage. We believe it is passion that deserves precedence over profession and that it is important to follow your true vocation. At the same time we also acknowledge the fact that vocations can undergo transformations. Whether a person is starting out afresh or is already following a career path, there is always that thought of doing ‘the other thing’. Where most of us fall out is when we need to address this conflict by taking a call. At our event we intend to have a carefully curated speaker line up that motivates the attendees to pursue their inner voice into their preferred line of work. TEDxJMI is a platform that’ll unite people who made successful switches with those who intend to do the same. However, all talks would be centred around the following elements individually or at large.","Speaker":null,"Teams":"72157720396778344","Previous":null,"Next":{"year":2017,"href":"/archive/2017"},"Gallery":"72157720449305135"},"__N_SSG":true}
